# Examples

Let me tell you about the Mush project, which is indeed a prime example of implementation using Mush and its own codebase.
In fact, Mush is a project entirely written in Shell Script and organized and built using Mush. 
You can visit its codebase at the following link, where you can explore some of its key components.

* [The Manifest file](https://github.com/javanile/mush/blob/main/Manifest.toml)
* [The main function](https://github.com/javanile/mush/blob/main/src/main.sh#L57)
* [The compiler](https://github.com/javanile/mush/blob/main/src/tasks/compile.sh)

## Other Examples

The project was initiated in September 2022, and as of now, there are no notable examples to showcase.
I would like to point out the BashUnit project, 
which has organized its codebase to be ready for Mush integration. You can find the link here.
