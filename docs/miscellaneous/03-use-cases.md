# Use Cases

On this page, a series of use cases involving the utilization of Mush are compiled.

## Lightweight Docker Images for CI/CD

In the realm of CI/CD, having ultra-lightweight Docker images to execute your jobs is paramount. The lighter the images, the shorter the execution times for tasks, thanks to faster image pulls. It's common to witness even the simplest tasks using images that start with Alpine and Python, but soon become heavy due to less-than-optimized installations of additional tools. Crafting well-organized scripts with Mush, perhaps leveraging libraries or equivalent utilities written in Bash, empowers you to have images consisting solely of Alpine and the scripts built with Mush. This translates to images that execute your CI/CD jobs at a mere fraction of the size, often clocking in at less than 4MB.

## Non-intrusive Provisioning of Instances

Often, when provisioning new machines and performing setup operations within them, Python or other tools are commonly used to interact with the target machine. However, if you aim to avoid even the installation of these tools, crafting purposeful programs with Mush can enable provisioning without installing anything - just a set of scripts that can be easily removed when the job is done.

## Situations Where Shell Projects Are Desirable

There are several scenarios in which the use of shell projects is desirable:

1. **Simple Automation**: When you need to perform straightforward automation tasks, such as copying, moving, or renaming files, the shell language is a quick and efficient choice.

2. **System Scripting**: For managing systems and servers, particularly in Unix-like environments, the shell language is a common choice for writing automation scripts.

3. **Workflow Management**: Shell scripting is useful for defining and automating workflows, such as periodic data backups, cleaning temporary files, or monitoring system resources.

4. **CI/CD Scripting**: In continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) processes, the shell language can be used to execute specific tasks within pipelines, such as application deployment or development environment management.

5. **Container Management**: For launching and managing Docker containers, shell scripts can be used to simplify container orchestration and related activities.

6. **Security and Compliance**: In certain situations, using shell scripts minimizes the attack surface and simplifies security checks and regulatory compliance.

7. **Resource-Constrained Environments**: In resource-constrained environments where it's not feasible to install more complex programming languages, the shell language remains a robust option.

8. **Natively Shell-Dependent Applications**: Some applications, such as certain network and system utilities, require the use of shell scripts to function properly.

In general, the shell language is valuable for basic automation tasks and system management, and it is often preferred when a lightweight and quick solution is needed.
In these cases, the role of Mush is to facilitate the operation of these projects within a shared standard, enabling reusability and modularity. Moreover, it equips developers in these contexts with a cutting-edge tool, similar to what's available for modern languages, while ensuring that these projects can seamlessly integrate with the power and flexibility of the shell environment.
