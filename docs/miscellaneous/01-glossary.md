# Glossary

In this page, definitions are gathered to prevent ambiguity within the context of the Mush project.

## Shell Package

A shell package is a software package primarily composed of scripts. It can encompass a variety of components, such as system or service configuration files, a collection of reusable scripts designed to work across multiple systems, a set of dotfiles, or even a simple software project that inherently benefits from being written in pure Bash. Examples of such packages include testssl.sh or acme.sh, which are distributed within low-footprint firewall systems. In the context of the Mush project, when we refer to a shell package or a package in general, we typically expect these shell packages to be accompanied by a Manifest.toml file. This file is used to manage distribution, compilation, and updates through Mush.
