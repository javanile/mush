# Coding Style Guidelines

Welcome to the Coding Style and Guidelines for Shell Scripting. This document outlines best practices and recommendations for writing clean and maintainable shell scripts.

## Introduction

Shell scripting is a powerful tool for automating tasks in Unix-like systems. Adhering to good coding practices ensures your scripts are readable and maintainable.

## Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive variable and function names.
- Variables should be in lowercase (e.g., `my_variable`).
- Constants should be in uppercase (e.g., `PI=3.14`).
- Functions should use `snake_case` (e.g., `my_function`).

## Indentation

- Use a consistent and readable indentation style (e.g., 4 spaces or tabs).
- Maintain proper alignment for conditional statements and loops.

Example:

```bash
if [ "$condition" == "true" ]; then
    echo "Condition is true."
else
    echo "Condition is false."
fi
```

## Comments

- Add comments to explain complex code or non-obvious decisions.
- Use clear and concise comments.
- Document the purpose and usage of functions and scripts.

Example:

```bash
# This function calculates the sum of two numbers.
calculate_sum() {
    # Add the two numbers together
    result=$(($1 + $2))
    echo "The sum is: $result"
}
```

## Error Handling

- Check for errors and handle them gracefully.
- Use `set -e` to exit on error and `set -u` to fail on undefined variables.
- Provide informative error messages to aid debugging.

Example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e
set -u

if [ ! -f "$file" ]; then
    echo "Error: File '$file' does not exist."
    exit 1
fi
```

### Useful References

Here are some useful references for improving your shell scripting skills:

- [Bash Official Documentation](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/)
- [ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/): A tool for analyzing shell scripts.
- [Google's Shell Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html)

Remember, these guidelines are meant to improve the quality of your shell scripts and make them more accessible to others. Happy scripting!
